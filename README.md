# Daily-Planner-WK5

## TL;DR 👀

A daily planner that can store events by hour from 9am to 5pm.
Grey time-block means past, red is current, and green is upcoming.   
** **Extra feature**: Users can also delete the tasks they no longer need.

## Usage

* Click on the text area to write desired task.
* Choose the floppy disk icon to save and eraser to remove task.

## Challenges

* JQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment Js were intimidating at first. After this project, I believe I have got the basics down and will be confident to try them out again in future project.
* Also got to practice writing If else statement using (?) operator.
* Tinkering with arrow function, but ended up not implement it in this project.
* Use prepend, setTimeout, .remove() to give a message that the events have been saved.
